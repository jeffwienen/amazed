Story
-----------
You're [name], a twenty year-old IT student. Your life is plain and boring, your days are always the same and you never have anything exciting happen in your life.
One day, you wake up, go to school and start your day by ordering a cup of coffee at the bar. You take the elevator up to the floor you're supposed to be on, power up your laptop and get ready to start programming away.

But you notice something strange! Your vision starts becoming blurry and you feel yourself drifting away! What is happening? Maybe you're little dehydrated and decide to take another sip of your coffee.
The moment your coffeecup touches your mouth you feel an extremely strong force pulling you towards the coffee. Your entire world is deforming and your vision goes black. Nothing.

After a few hours you regain conscience and open your eyes, and what you see is an entirely other world. It's dark and cold, and you immediately feel uncomfortable.
The first thing you notice is a big yellow portal which emits a very strong coffee smell. You wonder what in the world could have happened! You are surrounded by big, stone, castle-like walls. 
What do you do?!
